<!-- 
step1: install git for windows from https://git-scm.com/download/win 

step2: to check if it is installed properly type git --version in command prompt. it should display the version

step3: Now to add work folder to the git, open the work folder and right click. so I went to day31 folder and right clicked. click on git bash here option. now git command prompt appears.

type git init
    this initialises git inside that folder and a hidden .git folder will be created inside that folder


step4:type git status
       this scans the folder if the folder contents are tracked/added to git. if it has red files it means those files are untracked by git. so we need to add it to the staging area.

step5: type git add -A
       this adds the red files to staging area. Now we have to commit these files to local repository.

step6: type gir -m"message here for log purposes" commit
