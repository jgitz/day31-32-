<!-- git is a software for version control -->

<!-- git heirarchy

1) local storage: is the folder or space inside our local device where we write and store codes.

2) staging area: is a space we allot inside our local storage via git software installed in our device to add the codes we developed inside our local storage.

3) local repository: is a space we allot inside our local storage via git software installed in our device to commit the codes we added to staging area

4) remote repository: remote repository is a common space in cloud inside git hub where developers can push codes from our local repository

-->



<!-- git operation terminology

1) add: copies the codes from our local storage into the staging area.

2) commit: copies the codes from staging area to our local repository

3) push: copies and insert codes made by a developer from local repository into our remote repository 

4) clone: copies and distribute every code that are inside the  remote repository to all developers

5) pull: enable other developers to retrieve all latest addition of codes inserted into the remote repository

note: a developer cannot directly push codes from local storage into remote repository. Instead 
first, we add codes to staging area via add command
second, we commit codes into local repository using commit command
third, we push codes into remote repository using push command.
